# Baseline Skills for Flask

## 1. Basic Flask Setup  -- JC1 Standard: within 5 min
- Reminder: **NO RIGHT-CLICKING IS ALLOWED**.
- Create `Task4_4` main folder on Desktop.
- Create `index.html`, linking to external CSS `style.css`.
- Display the following:
  Black background, white text, Arial.
  Centralised table with 2 rows and 3 columns.
  Cells in second row has height and width of 100px.

## 2. Flask with Factorial and Fibonacci Numbers -- JC1 Standard: within 8 min
- Write two functions `factorial(n)` and `fib(n)` that run iteratively using for loop
- Display the results for n = 0 to 30 (inclusive) in a table, ensuring border and centralised text.
- No need for external CSS.

## 3. Flask with Fibonacci Numbers and Factors
- Write a recursive version of `fib(n)`. Note that this will be **highly inefficient**, with **exponential time complexity**!
- Write a function `factors(num)` that returns a **string** of all positive factors of `num`, e.g. `factors(6)` returns the string `1, 2, 3, 6`.
- Display a table with columns: n, fib(n), positive factors of fib(n) and rows for n = 0 to 20.
- No need for external CSS.
