## Introduction
In A Level H2 Computing, the importance of mastering baseline skills cannot be overstated. These fundamental skills form the backbone of every programming task and are essential for efficiently tackling the complex problems posed in the exam. The A Level curriculum emphasizes the integration of these skills, requiring students to weave together various programming concepts seamlessly.

To perform well, students must develop these baseline skills to the point where they become second natureâ€”ingrained into muscle memory. This proficiency allows them to complete the four extended tasks within the allocated 2 to 2.5 hours, leaving a crucial buffer of at least 30 minutes. This extra time is vital for ensuring that all requirements are met, code is properly styled, and files are correctly labeled and uploaded.

Each set of baseline skills is specific to different topics, and the key to mastery lies in rigorous practice under strict time constraints. Students should repeat this process until they consistently meet their targets, ensuring they are well-prepared for the challenges of the exam.
